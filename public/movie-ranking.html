<h1>The Best Movies According to Pradeep Singh</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>I feel like I’m always searching for something, someone.” Haven’t we all felt that at some point in
     our lives? A sense of displacement from our daily lives, and a search for something that would 
     anchor us to a more commonly perceived sense of normalcy? The Japanese phenomenon “Your Name”
    (it was the highest grossing film of last year in the country and the highest grossing anime
    film of all time worldwide, passing "Spirited Away") is about this highly relatable sense of 
    looking for something, someone, someplace. And so much more. It’s a beautiful, captivating piece
    of work that gets off to kind of a rocky start but achieves remarkable momentum toward an 
    emotional, powerful ending. And you won’t see a better-looking animated film all year.</p>

<h3>Suzume</h3>
    <p>Makoto Shinkai, the director of “Your Name” and “Weathering with You,” is one of the most successful current filmmakers in the world. His latest, “Suzume,” has already grossed over $200 million worldwide, a massive hit in both his home country of Japan but also in China, where it’s already the highest-grossing Japanese film ever imported to that country. What is it about Shinkai’s work that speaks to so many people? First, it’s gorgeous. He’s a master of light and shadows, shading his animated dramas with visual acumen that simply makes them more enchanting. He has an incredible ability to balance fantasy elements with real-world imagery, usually leaning on the beauty of the natural world as his gorgeous backdrop and producing shots that aren't over-considered as much as simply beautiful. But it’s not just the enchanting animation—Shinkai tells stories that resonate on a universal level while also being distinctly Japanese. There are key elements of “Suzume” that directly speak to the history of Japan and the fears of its people, but Shinkai’s gift is his ability to make the issues of trauma and anxiety feel like everyone’s. “Suzume” isn’t quite the masterpiece that is “Your Name” but I wouldn’t blame anyone for falling in love with it.</p>

<h3>The Space Between Us</h3>
<p>While the idea of moving to Mars might not sound so terrible right about now, “The Space Between Us” is about a young man who’s spent all of his 16 years on the red planet and can’t wait to visit Earth—specifically, to meet the cute high school girl with whom he’s sparked an online flirtation. Trouble is, he may not physically be able to withstand the journey—or last long once he gets here.</p>
